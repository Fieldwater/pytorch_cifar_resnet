# pytorch_cifar_resnet

There are two approaches .ipynb and .py file to train and reproduce our model.

1. Directly use main.py to train model in the python environment with torch tools
```
python main.py
```
2. Based on jupyter notebook, you can intuitively train and observe the intermediate results.
